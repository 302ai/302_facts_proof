Designed by the renowned architect Gustave Eiffel, the tower stands 330 meters tall and once housed the city's first observatory.\n\nWhile it's famously known for hosting over 7 million visitors annually, it was initially disliked by Parisians. Interestingly, the Eiffel Tower was used as to guide ships along the Seine during cloudy nights.",
